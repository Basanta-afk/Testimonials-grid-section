                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

                        ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
                        the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level
                        in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                        100% recommend! ‚Äù
